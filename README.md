JavaScript API OpenAI Image is a repository that provides a tool for generating image captions using the OpenAI Image API, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The tool allows users to upload an image and receive a description of the image generated using artificial intelligence algorithms.

The repository includes a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that provide the foundation for the image captioning tool. The HTML files include the basic structure for the tool and user interface, while the CSS files provide the styling and layout of the tool buttons and display. The JavaScript files contain the logic and algorithms for uploading the image to the OpenAI Image API, retrieving the caption generated by the API, and updating the tool display.

Users can customize the image captioning tool by modifying the JavaScript code or adding new features. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.
